# NAVIGATION APP

## What It Does
This program finds the shortest route between two cities by implementing **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. According to the coordinates of the input cities and their connections, the program draws the map and the route by taking the advantage of StdDraw library.
Thanks to the **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, this application finds the best route a lot faster compared to **brute force** approach.

## Report
You can check the report file for sample inputs and their outputs. Also, you can find the pseudocode for the **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and for the methods used in the program in the report. 

## Features
- **Fast:** Thanks to the **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, this program finds the best route faster than the brute force approach.

- **Compatible For Your Graph:** You can use the program with different coordinates of cities and different connections, but you need to change the map also.  

- **Total Distance:** You can see the total distance and the cities on the path on the console.

- **Visualization:** By using the StdDraw library, cities and the routes are drawn.  


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have installed the StdDraw library. Also, you need to have the input files in the input-files folder. 

### Usage
When the library is installed, you can start to use the program. Give the coordinates of the cities and connection of cities in separate files as an input. Then, enter a starting city and a destination city. Finally, the program finds the best route and draws the map.
